# ft_printf
# Project Overview 💡
This project is straightforward, involving the reimplementation of the printf function. Its primary focus is to provide hands-on experience with variadic arguments.

The objective of this project is to create a library that includes a simplified version of the printf function. For more detailed information, please refer to the project's subject document.

# Usage 🛠️
Requirements
The function is implemented in the C language and requires the gcc compiler and certain standard C libraries for proper execution.

Instructions
1. Compiling the library

To compile the library, navigate to its directory and execute the following command:

$ make
2. Incorporating the library in your code

To utilize the library functions in your code, simply include its header file:

#include "ft_printf.h"

# Testing 📋
For comprehensive testing of the project, you can employ a third-party tester such as Tripouille's printfTester.
